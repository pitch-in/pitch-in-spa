        Why Pitch In?
      </h2>
      <p>
        We know it’s critically important to elect more Democrats and progressive leaders on the local level. But it’s often those
        small, local races that have the hardest time getting off the ground. We believe that a lot of the resources and
        help our candidates need to win can be provided on a volunteer basis from skilled people ready to donate their time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The beauty of this system is that geography isn’t important. We believe that voter contact is most effective within communities.
        But web design and outreach, data modeling and targeting can be done by anyone with the skills, anywhere they are.
      </p>
      <p>
        Free up your campaign to do the hard and important work on the ground. We’ll help you connect with tech do-gooders to do
        the rest.
